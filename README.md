# Verlet-Intergration-Simulation
This is a physics simulation devloped using Verlet intergration., Verlet integration is a numerical method used to integrate Newton's equations of motion. For more information on Verlet Intergration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration.

# Controls
Using the hotbar at the top of the screen users can choose different options to create different structures using points and connecting points together. 
-Use the hot bar too select the diffrent tools, Use Right Click too make a point unmoveable
