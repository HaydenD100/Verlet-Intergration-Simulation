# Verlet-Intergration-Simulation
This is a simple simulation that I made using python and pygame for the GUI. Using the hotbar at the top of the screen users can choose different options to create different structures using points and connecting points together. For more information on Verlet Intergration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration.

# v1.0.1
Added Box coliders that particles can interact and bounce off of. Too create a box select the addbox button and click where you want the TOP LEFT corner of the box to be and then click where you want the BOTTOM RIGHT corner to be.
